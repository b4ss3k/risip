* What is Risip? *

Risip software provides a set of APIs, headers, source files and other utilities acting as interface the Pjsip library.

* How do I start? *

1. Download the latest Qt open source package and follow the instructions. (http://qt.io)

2. Build PJSIP
Use always the latest PJSIP available, download and follow the compilation and build steps provided by the PJSIP team.
Pjsip build instruction: https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/Getting-Started
Pjsip website: http://pjsip.org/
Pjsip documentation: https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/

Follow the instruction carefully and here are some notes to take care in particular:
-do not forget --prefix when you run configure for Pjsip, in this way you can install libs and headers of Pjsip
 in a seperate folder for each target platform.
-do not forget -arch flag for the architecture for iPhone or TARGET_ABI for android and so forth
-do not forget static/shared flags when configuring Pjsip, by default it is all static build for PJSIP
-do not forget to enable config_site.h file under PJSIP/src/pjsip-lib/include (follow steps: https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/Getting-Started)

3. QtCreator to load the Risip project.

You may use QtCreator to compile/build risip for all desktop platforms and Android, but for iOS you may need
to use XCode too.

Note:
Once you have build PJSIP and the libs and headers from pjsip are available, then copy them inside directory of risip.
For more details on where and which directory names to be used, please refer to the .pro project file in order to understand these details.
- do not forget Defines - just use the risip project file as sample
- do not forget Mac/iOS Frameworks or libs, same on Android and so forth

4. Use some SIP server to start testing
SIP accounts - Calls
- URI : sip:username@server.com
- registar: sip:server.com
- do not forget proxies and port number - if needed
- do not forget codecs , their priorities may break the call.
