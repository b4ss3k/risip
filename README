## What is Risip VoIP SDK? ##

Risip VoIP SDK provides a set of APIs, headers, source files and other utilities for creating and enabling RTC audio/video applications. 

Risip VoIP uses:
- Pjsip - please check Pjsip's website and documentation for more details.
- Qt - see Qt's documentation on how to install Qt on your environment.

Risip SDK APIs are intended pure Qt/QML based applications and/or just with Qt/C++.
